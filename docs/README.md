# Hello Vuepress@next!


## My firsts impressions

After experimenting with Nuxt and Gridsome and fail, I am **very happy** to find
that *vuepress@next* suits my needs

::: tip

this element is a div with class `tip`
:::

Continue [here](hello)

## Conclusions

Not definitive yet, but I will go for either Vuepress or Vuepress@next

A frustration: Have to learn TS.
